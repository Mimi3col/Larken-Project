# Larken-Project

The main line is for when you finish your seperat section. Create a branch you will work in spesificly and when you are ready merge with the main.
try merge with main every week and pull from the main once a week. This will allow us all to be on the same page. if everyone is working together and no one is editing anyone elses work without talkning with someone else we should not have any complications
