Just as you were leaving your previous location a notebook sized sheet of paper managed to catch your eye.
Unfortunately it was scrambled and is currently incomprehensible, however, on the back there were coordinates
that led you to a barrel stacked at the docks. Within this barrel you find a locked box and three scraps of paper which are presumably clues
to help open the locked box. Just as you begin to think "Perhaps the killer wants to be caught..." you shake your head and
get to work decoding the messages. Better be fast or he may strike again!
