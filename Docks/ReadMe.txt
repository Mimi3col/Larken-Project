1. Within the docks you will be challanged with puzzle solving using the vim system.
2. The puzzles will be solved with commands used to manipulate and control text within the vim window!
3. Each page of notes will have a .txt file associated with it that can help in learning how to manipulate the text inside so it is suggested to go there first.
4. If you get stuck for any reason just enter ctrl+c into the command line or "esc" and it should release you.
5. To run a bash program (the program that can be created using vim) you put "./filename.sh" and while in the vim window press "esc" ":" "q" "Enter" to exit and not save!
6. If you ever mess up and need to restart a note be sure to esc, :, q and go back in to try again.
