 
 now, you are able to see all the shelves we have, what
 would have happened if we were not so small, and had
 hundreds of shelves. 

 to have the terminal count the numebr of outputs we use 
 the 'wc' command, but we only need to see the number of 
 lines of output so we add on a ' -l' at the end of 'wc' 
 to have 
  
  wc -l 

  now if we type this in the terminal will not return 
  anything. the wc -l command needs something to search
  through much like 'grep'

  try typing 

  ls | wc -l  

  this will take the output of ls and return the number of 
  files and directories in the library
