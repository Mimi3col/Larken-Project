ACT ONE
1 EXT. MAIN QUAD, MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - NIGHT 1
FOOTBALL PLAYERS. CHEERLEADERS. A SEA OF SCREAMING, RILED UP
COLLEGE STUDENTS...because we've been thrust into the center of a
PEP RALLY for the MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY WARRIORS. By day, this
quad is filled with the best and brightest minds in the country --
future Rhodes Scholars and Nobel winners -- but right now? They're
just drunk. Spooky, foreboding music sets the tone as we MOVE
SLOW MOTION over the crowd. Even though it's the middle of winter,
the GUYS are SHIRTLESS, showing off their pecs painted in school
colors while their GIRLFRIENDS sit on their shoulders, chugging
from bottles of whiskey. It's a wild, rowdy, debaucherous ORGY
of school pride that only America's wealthiest children could get
away with. The only person who could possibly get them to pay
attention right now is the FOOTBALL COACH shouting into a mic on
the stage, a preacher with his disciples. He holds a TORCH.
FOOTBALL COACH
It's been a rough year, no doubt,
but that all ends Saturday! Because
that's when this team, my Warriors,
are gonna burn those lazy, cocky,
pansy-ass Princeton players to the
ground! AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
MIDDLETON?!! LET ME HEAR IT!!
As the crowd ROARS, the coach now brings the torch to a TOWERING
WOODEN EFFIGY behind him, the word "Princeton" painted across its
make-believe jersey. And as the effigy BURSTS INTO FLAMES and
the MARCHING BAND LAUNCHES INTO SONG, the camera suddenly speeds
up, pushing through the students and over the bonfire and past
the gothic buildings and ivy-covered arches that make up this
beautiful campus until we CRASH INTO --
2 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 2
It's dark and eerie as we whip past the trees, deeper and deeper
into the woods, the sounds of the pep rally fading behind us.
Suddenly the camera SCREECHES TO A HALT. We are now in a small
CLEARING. Through the dark we see 3 TWENTY-SOMETHINGS, a diverse
motley crew, shivering in the cold and freaking out. About what,
we'll soon discover. The first of them, MICHAELA PRATT (27,
preppy, type-A) paces and thinks as the two others sit, quiet and
trembling. She was born knowing how to "lean in" so that's what
she's going to do right now -- take control, CEO this shit.
MICHAELA
It's been too long. We did what we
said, we waited, we stuck to our
word, but we can't just sit here all
night. We have to do something.
And I know you're not going to like
it, but I'm calling Aiden.
 2.
PATRICK
ARE YOU HIGH??!
Under normal circumstances, PATRICK DONAHUE (25) is sexy,
sophisticated, confident, cool, and hyper-articulate. Right now
though? He's shitting his pants.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
We're not calling your fianc√©! We
wait. THAT is what we decided so
THAT is what we're going to do.
MICHAELA
I was never part of that decision.
PATRICK
Because you had a meltdown! You
could barely make a sentence! So
shut up, sit down, and stop acting
like a little bitch baby.
MICHAELA
I am acting like a person does in a
situation like this!
PATRICK
No. You're hysterical and you need
to calm the hell down.
MICHAELA
DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT
NOW!
WES (O.S.)
Hey.
They all jump, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER, just like we do at home,
because now a 4th person stands there. Meet WES GIBBINS (27).
Wes is boyish, easy-going, instantly likable...and his t-shirt is
covered in blood.
WES (CONT'D)
Sorry it took me so long. I went
back for this.
Wes removes a backpack, pulls out a TROPHY, also covered in blood.
MICHAELA
Wes! Why'd you bring that here?
Take it back right now.
LAUREL
No. It's smart.
Finally we hear from LAUREL WILDING (23, bookish, introverted).
She's been quiet up till now. 
 3.
That's her thing -- she's a thinker, an observer, the type of person
easy to underestimate. She has the answer now though, decisive,
confident.
LAUREL (CONT'D)
The People vs. Gallivan! Pennsylvania
vs. Gottlieb! code: 2 Cases the prosecution
should've won but lost because there
was no murder weapon...
PATRICK
So what are you saying?
LAUREL
We clean it and put it back. Hide
it in plain sight.
(beat)
After we bury the body.
A long beat as everyone takes that in. Then --
MICHAELA
No, absolutely NOT.
PATRICK
I agree with Michaela.
LAUREL
Patrick--
PATRICK
The trophy we need, yes. But the
body stays where it is.
LAUREL
The body is what gets us caught.
PATRICK
Then why'd we leave it there in the
first place?
LAUREL
Because we panicked. All of us.
But now that we're finally thinking
straight--
MICHAELA
You are not thinking straight--
LAUREL
Then what do you suggest??!
MICHAELA
Something that doesn't involve
carrying a body across campus on the
busiest night of the year! 
 4.
PATRICK
She's right, Laurel. Even if we
were able to get it out of the house,
unseen, the ground is frozen--
LAUREL
We have all night to dig!
PATRICK
You don't know what you're talking
about!
LAUREL
This is murder, none of us know what
we're talking about!
MICHAELA
Please, just yell that a little louder--
WES
Hey...
MICHAELA
Honestly, you're all dumber than I
thought if you think we should go
back there.
PATRICK
I'm agreeing with you!
Now everyone's yelling, except Wes who keeps trying to interrupt.
