 Hello, welcome to the library. To move around you
 should know the comands 'ls', 'cd', 'cat', and to 
 interact with the programs you need './'
 
 as you know we can do basic commands in the terminal, 
 if you 'cat ReadMe.md' you are able to see everything
 inside the file, but we can also do multiple commands
 on a single line.

 this is done by useing the pipe command '|' between 
 command portions. 

 if we want to search though an output we need to use 
 the command 'grep' but grep needs something to search
 through so we have the 'pipe' commnad help it with a 
 place to search through. 
 
 if we do,

    ls | grep 'Shelf'

    the results of doing the ls command is sent to the 
    grep command so it can search through for files and 
    directories with the name Shelf 

 try typeing it now:
